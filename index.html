                <p>Temptations are meant to lure you away from what it is that is correct, or what it is that you
                    are supposed to be doing.</p>
                <p>When your mind is left to wander, you allow yourself to imagine where you might end up if you
                    were to<br>
                    <br>

                    give in to your temptations. There is often a negative implication associated with temptations,
                    which can usually result in you finding yourself in some trouble.
                </p>
                <p>However, being self-disciplined allows you to resist the temptations that you find your mind
                    questioning. Recognizing that you have big-picture goals, you are more likely to have the will power
                    to say 'No' to what may appear like the more attractive option in the short-term.</p>

                    2. Self-Discipline Increases Your Focus
                </h3>
                <p>When you are self-disciplined, you have the ability to remain focused on the task at hand. There will
                    always be distractions and temptations around you.</p>
                <p>However, when you are self-disciplined, you recognize the importance of the activity you are working
                    on. You also recognize that the hard work you are putting in will play a larger role in what you are
                    trying to achieve.</p>
                <p>Remaining focused is half the battle. When you have a clear understanding of your goals and plan to
                    achieve them, you have the self-discipline to stay focused and keep pursuing your dreams. When
                    others are making excuses or looking for reasons to quit, you continue to be focused and work
                    tirelessly.</p>

                <p>It is tough to remain motivated when you don't see any results for your hard work, or when you are
                    stuck in a routine that doesn't promote happiness or fulfillment. There will always be those days,
                    regardless of where you are at in your life.</p>
                <p>However, you will find it easier to remain motivated when you can be more disciplined in how you
                    choose to spend your time. When you are disciplined with your time, it helps to keep you engaged in
                    the activity you are taking part in.</p>
                <p>Too much of anything is a bad thing and can lead to you being unmotivated with your approach to
                    various aspects of your life.</p>
